This iteration focuses on redesigning the application to provide more information on the cards introduced in the previous iteration.

Changes made:
<ul>
  <li>
    Favorites page renamed to Home
  </li>
  <li>
    Booked page renamed to Appointments
  </li>
  <li>
    Pending renamed to Updates
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards now provide more information from last iteration
  </li>
  <li>
    Navigation bar changed from curved_navigation_bar to google_nav_bar
  </li>
  <li>
    Search bar addition in the home page
  </li>
</ul>

Redundant code has been removed from the Dart files for better efficiency. Imports are now consolidated into a separate file named 'imports.dart' to prevent the accumulation of import lines over time.
